# react-blog
A basic blog website created using react.js
This is my first project created using react.js, but hopefully not my last.

This blog site allows for the user to create a post using the 'new blog post' page, and this information is then taken and stored in a cloud database. The main page then retrieves these posts from the database using an API call, and displays them using a card component. Finally, the user can favourite posts and these are then displayed in a seperate feed on the 'My Favourites' page.
